On a recent trip to Phoenix, I stopped at one of the numerous horse
farms in the outskirts of the city to watch a trainer putting a beautiful
horse through a routine. After several questions, the trainer told me he
once had a horse who was so talented that he taught it to play the violin.
Said he called it, 'Fiddler on the Hoof.'

My funny valentine (Open huge valentine - I'm inside).
Sweet comic valentine.
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable (Shot of audience laughing).
Unphotographable (Camera blows up).
Yet you're my favorite work of art (Mona Lisa - my head).
Is your figure less than Greek (Draped toga - column).
Is your mouth a little weak (Crooked mouth).
When you open it to speak (A comic balloon with lots of printed errors).
Are you smart (Or Dunce Cap & Stool Blackboard).
