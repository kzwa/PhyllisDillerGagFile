I'm always impressed by the books people say they would like to have
along if they're shipwrecked on a desert island. It's always something
heavy like the Complete Works of Shakespeare or the Encyclopedia
Brittanica. Personally, I'd lean to something more practical, like "101
WAYS TO COOK SAND" or "THE SENSUOUS COCONUT."

You never can tell what will make a best-seller. For instance, one of the
best-selling books in America today is a manual on how to build ship
models in bottles -- and it's all because of the opening sentence: First,
empty a fifth of Jack Daniels.

He still has fun, though. He shares an apartment with two other old
gentlemen. They play some games. The 3 of them sit in a room and one
gets up and leaves. The other two stay behind and try to figure which
one left.
