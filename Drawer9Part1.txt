Reporter: Miss Diller, I hear you have given up cigarettes. What do you
do to prevent jitters?

Miss Diller: Well, several things. First when I feel the urge to smoke
creeping up I run and collect all the cigarettes in the house and take
them to the bathroom and flush it! Then I hid all my shoes. This takes a
long time because I have several pair and I divide them up so there are
no mates hidden together and they must both be for either the right foot
or the left. You may not understand how I do this but it is a system I
worked out. Original, you might say. By the time I get this done, I am
shaking like a leaf with a gone feeling here (holds stomach) so I run to
the refrigerator and stuff myself with left overs - usually hash, then while
I am chewing this up I go put all my money in piggy banks or that one
that the bank has the key to, so I won't be tempted to go out barefoot
and buy more cigarettes. Next I run out and throw the car keys on top of
the house. Then I grab some more to eat, find the scissors and cut the
telephone wire so I can't call the neighbors and beg for a smoke. Then I
take three aspirin and 5 or 6 tranquilizers. By this time I feel myself
slipping away so I have to have several shots of whiskey to bring me out
of it. Along about this time my husband comes home for supper and the
next thing I remember is lying in a hospital bed where they have
pumped out my stomach and I'm screaming like a mad woman for
somebody to bring me a cigarette.

Reporter: Would you recommend that addicts like yourself quit
smoking?

Diller: O, definitely, It gives you such a feeling of accomplishment!
