Transcription of Phyllis Diller's Gag File (from http://collections.si.edu/search/tag/tagDoc.htm?recordID=nmah_1218385)

The Smithsonian Museum of American History has an extensive joke archive created by Phyllis Diller, which they have made available for transcription.

Diller's gag file consists of a steel cabinet with 48 drawers (along with a 3 drawer expansion) containing over 52,000 3-by-5 inch index cards, each holding a typewritten joke or gag. These index cards are organized alphabetically by subject, ranging from accessories to world affairs and covering almost everything in between. 

More information about the project is here: https://transcription.si.edu/project/8927

A PDF of the transcription is availalble via the Smithsonian catalog (http://collections.si.edu/). I used PDFMiner to extract the text (https://github.com/euske/pdfminer/)
