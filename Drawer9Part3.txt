Nowadays Russians fall into two distinct categories: The first group are
those who want to escape to the United States so they can have
freedom, their own home, a car, enough to eat, and all the vodka they
can drink.  The second group are those who want to escape to the
United States so they can have freedom, their own home, a car, enough
to eat, and then they wouldn't need all the vodka they can drink.

Russians are very practical people. On my last bisit to Moscow, I asked
a Russian official about their form of government. He said, "it's very
simple. under communism, if I have a million rubles, I share it with you. If
I have a 20 room mansion, I share it with you. if I have a brand new
suite, I share it with you. And if I have a bottle of Vodka --' I said, "Would
you share it with me?" He said, "Nyet." I said, "why not?" He said, "I
have a bottle of vodka."

McElhatton is a ham - he is the only man in the world who had his teeth
fixed - to go on radio - when he opens the door to his refrigerator - and
the light goes on - he tells a joke - he says: A funny thing happened to
me on the way to the refrigerator - I fell over a toad stool which
fortunately fell out of the mushroom soup - before we ate it.

He frequently slips on the floor of the kitchen - because his wife - a
former model of Goodwill gowns - doesn't really know how to clean a
floor - she cold creams it - she hates wrinkled floors - one day he slipped
as he was carrying out the garbage - and one of his wife's friends
dropped in to drop off a book from the library - called Cave Age Cooking
- noticed the floor - and said: My dear - what a beautiful new flowered
rug - talk about sculptured - talk about grain - is that real grain - Yes, we
had grain for dinner - what texture - If I don't know better - I'd say that is
a real tomato --

Only man in the world with foam rubber gums.

He smiles on radio - it's in his voice box - which was a gift wrapped at
Gump's - gift-wrapped tonsils - When you hear Dave - with a rose in his
teeth - his teeth are so bad - How many people have roses growing in
them - If you press butterflies - if you are the kind of person who would
like to tap maples so the syrup is fresh - listen to the freshest guy on
radio - Dave McH - you talk about fresh - he called Grandma Moses an
easle beaver - to her face - when her back was turned - but she got help
- later that day - went to an osteopath - who gave her an adjustment, but
after she left, she said: Either my back is worse, or there's lumps on his
table.

If you are the kind of person who celebrates national library week - by
burning your card - you're a McH fan - listen to the happy illiterate - at
the man who invented the triple breasted suit - holds all the patents on it
- the P[[INSERT]]a[[/INSERT]]tent leather - what ever happened to blue
suede -

One thing you're not going to hear on the McH show - ever - is poetry -
with jazz - you may hear poetry - and you may hear jazz - but never at
the same time - they aren't scared about using every minute - you'll hear
them separately - none of that Beatnik stuff - because McH shaves
daily.

This man makes a commercial sound like September Song.

Some of the listeners of the McH show wonder what he looks like - well,
if you don't know - you're lucky - he has reached that age where he's
standing up - and his body is sitting down - how he reached it so fast - I'll
never know - because actually - he's young - he may have hurried - he
appeals to women - in an odd way - he has all the charm of a married
Liberace - he's

a combination of Rock Hudson, Jim Backus and Trigger. The man with
the unbuttoned lip - the man with the Long Play mouth - he talks - talks -
sings in H. flat - which is why they were evicted - of course his kids had
written on the walls too - with their mother's lipstick - thank goodness -
they couldn't spell - his wife is the president of the very chic women's
union suit league - their slogan - bring back union suits for women - to
bring down the cost of nylons - she is the only woman in the world who
flies a drop-seat broom - she flew past the milky way one night - and
curdled it - she is the kind of woman who flies a plane - around the globe
- and then cuts herself on a marshmellow - and has to have intra venus
feeding - thank goodness - Venus wasn't busy.
