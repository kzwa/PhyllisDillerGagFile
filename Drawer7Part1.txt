BIRTHDAY
Ray Rieves
31/OCT/1964

My daughter just turned six. And she wanted to have a birthday party.
But I made two mistakes. The first was saying yes, and the second
mistake was letting her turn six. Six is a very difficult age. You're too old
for Art Linkletter and too young for Dear Abbey.

Ray Rieves
31/OCT/1964

Kids always reflect the habits of their parents. Some of them bragged -
some were loud - some were quiet - and one boy spiked the punch. I
didn't notice anything unusual until a boy staggered up to me and said,
"What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?"
