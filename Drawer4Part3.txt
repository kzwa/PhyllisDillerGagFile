During the maneuvers in Kansas, one soldier came floating down into
camp during gusty high winds. Battered and bruised, he was taken
before his commanding officer, who said to him: "It took a lot of nerve to
come parachuting down in this wind, but you ought to have better sense
than to do anything so dangerous."
"But, I didn't come down in a parachute," protested the soldier. "I went
