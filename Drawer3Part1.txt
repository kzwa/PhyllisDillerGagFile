Cars are so automatic today.  This morning I ran out and got in my car.
Pushed one button and the window came down - pushed another button
and the motor started - pushed another button and the car moved
forward.  Then I called the tow truck.  I forgot to press the button that
opened the garage door.

One day I was out in the car and it began to sputter and then it stopped
and I couldn't get it to go, so I went to a phone booth and called Fang.
When I told him what was wrong, he said, "You idiot, it's out of gas!"
Then I asked him a simple question and he blew up, Just BLEW UP! All
I said was, "Will it hurt to drive it home that way?"
