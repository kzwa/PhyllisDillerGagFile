I just had an unusual experience. Met this fella six feet tall wearing a ten
gallon hat; cowboy boots; lots of money; owns oil wells; a cattle ranch.
What makes it so unusual, he's from Vermont.

We have a beloved guest with us today, a former Miss Universe, Betsy
Drag Race - Miss Drag Race - is that a hyphenated name? No, there's a
question mark in the middle - What does that mean. If I knew, there
wouldn't be a question mark there.
Miss Drag Race, you are a former Miss Universe. Yes - I was Miss
Universe back in the days when the Universe was nothing but a hole in
the world - before they were sending up all that garbage - rockets - there
were just ghost riders in the sky. (sing) - Ghost Riders in the Sky.
Yes, Miss Drag Race -
Ghost Riders in the Sky.
Miss -- are you against rockets?
I'm against everything - you name it - I'm against it.
Why are you against rockets?
It's an awfully expensive way to get rid of one mouse.
Ghost Riders in the Sky.
What do you mean?
When I have a mouse I take a little 10 cent trap and I put a little piece of
cheese on it - and ka-jook - I catch it -- they find one mouse in the
Pentagon, and they send it away in a $5 million trap and then expect it
to wire back and sing Wish You Were Here - Wish You Were Here -
They're not making the stars so bright this year.
Would you care to go on a rocket to the moon?
Not unless things get a lot worse here - Wish You Were Here - Wish
You Were Here -
It is generally known, Betsy - you don't mind if I call you Betsy.
Oh no - not at all - I'm sick of being called Sam.
Wish You Were Here - Wish You Were Here.
Betsy - you were one of the most ravishing beauties of your day -
ravishing is the word - isn't it?
That's the word all right.
What is the secret of your long successful life?
They say that we're too young to love - too young -what was that quest.
Well I think it's pretty obvious that I have found the secret of eternal
youth. I eat health food - eat plenty of dried snake fangs - raw fish,
seaweed, alf alpha, butterfly feet, that junk, I eat lots of health food - I
hate it - it makes me sick.
They say that we're too young to love.
What else?
I bathe whenever I have a chance - which is when I have a room - that's
about twice a year - I do it the same day I see my dentist.
They say that we're too young to love.
Would you say you have a good dentist?
Yes, he's lovely - he saved my tooth - he's darling -- washes his hands
twice a year - whether they need it or not.
They say that we're too young to -

You are very fond of your dentist?
He's the greatest - we usually make a day of it --
He cooks spaghetti in the sterilizer - then he wraps it around my teeth -
The spaghetti?
No, the sterilizer. How do you think he saved my tooth?
They say that we're too young to love, too young to really be -
Alright- you eat health food - you're a cleanliness addict -
you take good care of your tooth - you've definitely found the secret of
eternal youth. And I understand that you - a former Miss Universe - are
celebrating your birthday today -
how old are you?
I'm 23.

Our next guest is lovely Jane Jackson - hello Jane - it's lovely to see
you. What line of work are you in?

I'm a nuclear physicist (difficulty pronouncing it) giggle.

Nuclear Physicist.

Yes, that's it.

Where do you base your operations?

I spend most of my time at Cape Carnival.

Canaveral.

That's it - Carniverous - Cape Carniverous.

What do you do at Cape Canaveral?

I send up the rockets.

Tell us about it.

Well - it's top secret and I can't say too much about it, but the last one I
sent up - oh golly - what a mess - well, the rocket got off beautifully - but
Cape Carnival is no longer in Florida - it's in Alaska - that's why they
made it a state - to get the launching pad back. And the men who made
the final checks on the rocket, just before I sent it up - are in Connecticut
- Texas - India and Madagascar.

And one guy who got his coat caught on the rocket - keeps sending us
messages saying he's out of this world.
