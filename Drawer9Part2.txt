And once during the last great war - the one that was advertised I was
making a pudding - and I called the Dupont people - and I said: I think
you'd better send a man out - I have something here that will interest
you. I couldn't get the spoon out - They sent a man out - and he tried to
stir it - and the whole room went around. I had invented the first bullet
