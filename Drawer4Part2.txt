I should make an appointment for her with my man, a Dr. Wentworth. I
don't know if this doctor lives up to his reputation, but he certainly lives
up to his name. After a few visits, I wondered where the money WENT,
and whether it was WORTH it all in the first place.

But we all have so many things to be thankful for. Like Frank Sinatra is
thankful.  If things work out, he could be the first guy ever to raise a
family under Medicare!

The way Medicare is going, I would guess that in 1970 it will pay for
dentists; in 1975 it will pay for psychiatrists; and in 1980 it will pay for
get-well cards!
