R.L. PARKER
LOAN COMPANY SKETCH
31/Oct/1964
I come from a neighborhood of borrowers.  We neighbors borrowed the
neighborhood - from the local bank.

Our neighborhood is so mortgaged that, before one of us can get a loan
at the bank, our community has to pool its assets for collateral.  At the
last meeting our pool was a small puddle.

At loan companies you can borrow money real quick.  I walked into a
loan company - with the help of my creditors - said my name is Diller
and the girl says "Sign here and your payment will be $100.00 per
week."

I said "I only want to borrow $75.00.  She said, In that case your
payment will be $125.00 per week."

I said, "Where am I going to get this kind of money."  She said, "Try the
loan company next door."

I walked next door and said "Hello" and this girl said:  "Your payments
are delinquent."  I said "What payments?"  She said, "Hhave you made
any?"  I said "On What?"  She said, "On the loan you want to get."

This whole thing started when the loan company advertised that I could
consolidate all of my debts.  That's how I paid off the other loan
companies.  Now I can't remember how I got in debt in the first place.

I've been getting letters from the loan company.  The first reminded me
that the payment was due - a couple of hours earlier.  The next letter
carried a mild threat - on my life.  It was attached to the first letter.  Then
the next letter pointed out I was hopelessly in debt and offered me
another loan to take care of my situation.  Our government should
outlaw those type of loans but that is how the government is financing
it's operation.  Those loan companies start out on a shoe string and
work their way right up to your purse string.

This loan company foreclosed on our home.  It made Fang so mad that
he brought in a house full of termites.  When we left there was just the
aluminum storm windows and doors with chimney.
