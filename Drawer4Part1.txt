The hospital are so impersonal. You can't believe the things nurses do
to you while discussing the weather...I mean, it's one thing to be familiar,
but I didn't know if I was having my first operation or second honey-
moon. And after all this they suddenly get coy. When they give you a
bed bath, they wash 95% of you with a damp cloth and then when they
get to the most interesting part, they let you finish the job. That's like
being invited to the wine cellar for ginger ale!

Aunt Frank...

She's one of my favorite uncle's...wife.
A devout hypochondriac...she's been completely immunized against
good health.
She could bankrupt the Medic-Care Program.
She had so many complaints last summer she kept four doctors in
Florida...all winter.
One time she decided she had arthritis...in her hair. It was a wig.
So naturally, she had most of her teeth pulled out of her upper plate.
Another time her nose was paralized...she had to talk through her
mouth.
She's allergic to air...now this creates a small problem if you plan to
breath.
Her disorders caused nervousness, nausea, vomiting and fainting
spells... that's her doctor.
He can't stand sickness.
She's a chronic complainer...figures "Every little bitch helps." Her doctor
won't go see her anymore...he just sends a bill...once a month. One
month he missed sending her a bill... she had a relapse.
She wrote her autobiography...its a medical textbook.
When Aunt Frank says she couldn't feel worse she really hasn't tried.
Sometimes she gets to feeling so bad her husband has to have a shot.
In no time he's drunk.
You should see him... he's the perfect picture of health-failure.
Everytime I go see her she gets out their photo album...of x-rays.
They've got one group picture.
Some of Aunt Frank's closest friends are dying...over and over. There's
only a few who haven't died before. She had to be first... first to go...and
come back.
She has a neighborhood club... for the handy sick pack. They make up
the local A.A....Always Ailing.
Each member is dedicated to helping all members feel worse
At their regular club meetings they study good health habits...so they
can avoid 'em.
At their luncheons they serve pills.
Her group is writing a book titled, "Symptoms That Can't Be
Described...Well."
It's a sequel to their earlier book, "Unknown Pains.
One time I asked if her friends ever get well. She said, "Some do on
weekends."
I said, "Why Weekends?"
She said, "They can't afford to be sick 7 days a week."

To her a minor operation is the kind anybody else has.
Her club has group insurance... the premiums make 'em sick.
The policy doesn't cover hospitalization... it pays the bribe to get you in
the hospital.
It will also finance the purchase of all medicines advertised on TV in one
evening.
Her pill box is a suitcase.
Aunt Frank came to stay with us for a week...she took so many pills our
water bill went up.
She eats too...two of everything...two lunches...two dinners...that's in the
night.
In between meals she'll have a large sandwich of calories.
She's so fat her wrinkles make her look like she's quilted.
She looks like an obese person who has gotten fat.
She worries about it too...she thinks she's swollen.
When she sweats it isn't a case of the pores opening up...it's more like a
dam.
She's so heavy she wore blisters on her shoes.
She's only 5 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds...you can see its packed in
there pretty well...around her ankles.
She won a duck-walking contest one time standing up.
She'll take a little nip now and then...she's nipped the postman...She just
gets hungry.
She can get rough...she broke up a ball game one time...and she was
watching it on TV.
