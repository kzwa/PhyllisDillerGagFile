Actually, Fang started out as a fighter.  His mother, Ray, had always
dreamed about being heavy weight champion on the world, but she
didn't know how to fight clean.  She was always bragging about the time
she made John L. Sullivan say "uncle."  It turned out he thought she
[[underscore]] was [[/underscore]] his uncle.

And he was probably the only fighter whose trunks were held together
with an Orphan Annie Secret Decoder pin.  That man had spent so
much of his life in bed that whenever he heard a bell, he'd just reach

he asked who'd paid for the first.
