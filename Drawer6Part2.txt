Mom joined a group who holds meetings on Wednesday afternoon for
what she calls a daily hour of silence. I said, "How can you have a daily
hour of silence and only meet on Wednesday?" She said, "There are 7
of us. I represent Saturday." I said, "Do you meet for an hour once a
week?" She said, "Yes, frequently." I said, "How can it be frequently, if
you definitely meet once a week. Which is it?" She said, "Infrequently,
we meet for 2 hours." My answer to that was, "I see." Then I asked what
the hour of silence was for and she told me that they are trying to hold
on to what they have. So they spend their time trying to think of
everything they know. If they get through before the hour is up they rest
their brain. She said some of the women know so much they run over
time. I said, "Why do you each represent a day in the week?" The
answer, "It's in behalf of science. We're trying to find which is the best
day for thinking." I don't know how Mom spends her hour with the group.
