smash it over Grandma's head. Grandma reacts by telling them to quit
taking ugly pills. Giving free advice is another of Leo's hangups.
Oftentimes, they will stop strangers on the street and give them direction

LIBRA THE BALANCE

People born under this sign who bay at the moon called "Unbalanced
Libras."  Libra is symbolized by the Scales.  Which often leads to dry
skin, and in some cases, to flakey behavior.  Librans visiting aquariums
often get a come-hither look from a fish.  Yours is the cardinal sign, and
causes you to look like a very religious person, ballplayer or bird.
Librans are mediators and peacemakers.  When challenged to come out
into the alley for a fistfight, librans gracefully say, "OK", But if I don't
show up, go ahead and start

without me." You should avoid jobs that require heavy decisions, like
separating watermelons from banjos. Libra folks can be serene or mean
on short notice. This indicates they can charm the birds off the trees, but
then eat them. You are very hospitable and extend a warm welcome to
unexpected guests. When a gang of escaped convicts invades a
Libran's house, those good hosts hastily arrange a get-acquainted block
party and dance. Famous Libra: Mrs. Achilles, armor welder, gracious
but irate hostess. When her warrior husband refused to help clean up
the post-party mess, she yelled, "You're nothing but a heal, Achilles."

Some of the men are so strong and silent, they have cobwebs on their

Famous Scorpio: Ludwig Von Beethoven. Quote: "I'll start on my sixth

[[/underlined]]

With archery as their dominating influence, many Sagittarians will shoot
an arrow into the air and then get mad when they don't hit anything.
Some even put glue on their arrow tips hoping they will stay up. Many of
Sagittarius' arrows fall to earth they know not where. However, one stray
arrow did come down and puncture a previously contented cow's udder,
which led to a lawsuit by an angered farmer who was stuck with a leaky
Guernsey. Cupid, the romantic archer, unerringly aims his love-dart into
the backends of unwary

couples who stoop over to pick up the nickels he has scattered. He then
directs them to his discount furniture store. Sagittarius youngsters are
restless and squirmy. They should be checked for worms. Persons born
of this sign are intrigued by strange lands and faraway places. Thus,
many Sagittarian children find their school lunches wrapped in road
maps. Adults are supersensitive to harsh criticism. Oftentimes, when
being bawled out by the boss, they will throwup on his shoes.
Sagittarians born around Thanksgiving Day will kiss a turkey on the lips
and think nothing of it. Neither does the turkey.

Persons of this sign kid around a lot and enjoy butting into

their chin whiskers, and usually name their sons, Billy. Capricorns are
thrifty and will look for bargains in used dental floss. Some are born

late night variety shows. For some adults, water on the knee is a
